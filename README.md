# Peer-to-Peer-file-sharing-program
Kaleab Belete Belay, ATR/3763/09, Section-02
This repository contains a peer-to-peer file sharing program that can be used to exchange files over a network

The program can be used to exchange files among peers over a network. 
To use the program, enter:
python peer.py host_address, port_number, file_to_send, file_to_receive

If the program doesn't find a server with the specified address, it becomes the server and accepts connections. Otherwise, it connects
to the server and begins exchanging files.
